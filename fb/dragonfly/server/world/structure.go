// Structure represents a structure which may be placed in the world. It has fixed dimensions.
type Structure interface {
	// Dimensions returns the dimensions of the structure. It returns an int array with the width, height and
	// length respectively.
	Dimensions() [3]int
	// At returns the block at a specific location in the structure. When the structure is placed in the
	// world, this method is called for every location within the dimensions of the structure. Additionally,
	// At may return a Liquid to be placed in the same place as the block.
	// At may return nil to not place any block at the position. Returning Air will set any block at that
	// position to air, but returning nil will not do anything.
	// In addition to the coordinates, At will have a function passed that may be used to get a block at a
	// specific position. In scope of At(), structures should use this over World.Block(), due to the way
	// chunks are locked.
